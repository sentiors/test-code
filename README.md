This grading-API repository is compatible with the gradingctl repository, so it is highly recommended to use gradingctl as well if you want to use grading-API.

This is an automated Linux-based practical lab assessment system, where students run CLI tools on their own environment and the data from their work is collected and assessed automatically by a central server (Flask API).

1. Each student registers and logs in, then starts a specific lab.
2. Detailed feedback (what is wrong/has not been done) is immediately provided to students for troubleshooting.
3. The duration of the work and score penalties can be calculated automatically.
4. Teachers can add or edit new grading schemes via the GUI.
5. Facilitates objective, fast, and consistent web-based grading for all students.
6. Students can immediately see their results, detailed feedback, and troubleshooting without waiting for manual corrections.

To use, simply copy this repository to your server!

Thank you.
